# Silly Atari 2600 Guys

These are some programs I wrote for Atari 2600, mostly for my own reference.
They're made to be assembled with DASM, and there is [a tiny script](/assemble) for convenience.

## Smiley

Smiley face using the playfield

## Movin

Horizontally moving player

## Vertical

Horizontally and vertically moving player. Changes color based on movement direction.
